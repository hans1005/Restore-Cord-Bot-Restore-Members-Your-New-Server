<p align="center"><b>üåâ A cord to connect your Revolt and Discord servers</b></p>

üîó A bridge for Discord and [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) with easy setup through commands, written in TypeScript using [revolt.js](https://github.com/revoltchat/revolt.js).

For example, if the card is a Green 7, you must play a Green card or any color 7. Or, you may play any Wild card or a Wild Draw 4 card. If you don't have anything that matches, you must pick a card from the DRAW pile and lose your turn by entering draw in your uno-channel. Each player can only play one card in their turn.

Play a card by entering <color><value> in your uno-channel. For example, if you wish to play a Green 7, enter green7 in your uno-channel. Play a Wild Draw 4 by entering <color>+4. You may choose not to play a playable card from your hand. If so, you must draw a card.

Winning
When a player no longer has any cards and the game ends, they receive points. All opponents‚Äô cards are given to the winner and points are counted. This also applies even if the last card is an Action card, such as a Draw Two or a Wild Draw 4 ‚Äì The next player must draw the required cards which will then be tallied up.

## Command list

Instead of prefixes, Nessie uses Discord's new [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) `/`
- `br`: map rotation for battle royale
- `arenas`: map rotation for arenas
- `control`: map rotation for control
- `about`: information hub of Nessie
- `help`: list of commands and how to use them
- `invite`: generates Nessie's invite link
- `updates`: shows the latest news and current update of Nessie

## TODO
- Automatic Map Status Updates
- Add installation guide to this readme

## üî© Setup

New: You can use [Docker](#using-docker) instead.

**Node v16.9+ is required!**

Important: this bot is meant to be used in one server (Discord+Revolt), but can be used in more as long as they share the same admin.

1. Clone this repository, install dependencies and build
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mayudev/revcord
cd revcord
npm install
npm run build
```
2. Create a bot in Discord ([Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)) and Revolt (Open user settings -> `My Bots` -> `Create a bot`)
3. Place the relevant tokens in environment variables. The easiest way is to create a `.env` file (yes, a file called `.env`):
```
DISCORD_TOKEN = ...
REVOLT_TOKEN = ...
```
Of course, replace ... with tokens.

If you are running a self-hosted instance of Revolt, additionally set the `API_URL` variable:
```
API_URL = https://api.revolt.chat
```

4. **Important!** Make sure to select the following permissions in URL Generator when making an invite for your bot (Your bot in Discord Developers -> `OAuth2` -> `URL Generator`) (or if you're lazy, just select `Administrator`) Note **applications.commands**!
   
![permissions](docs/permissions.png)

5. **Important!** On Revolt, make sure to add the bot to a role that has the **Masquerade** permission!

![revolt permissions](docs/mask.png)

6. Invite the bot to to a Revolt and Discord server.
7. Start the bot using `npm start`.

Note: it's recommended to use something like [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to run the bot. Make sure to pass the `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node` flag to node manually, otherwise it will not run (it's included in the default start script).

### Using Docker

You need Docker and docker-compose installed.

Follow the steps above to create a `.env` file[^1]. You do not have to run `npm install` and `npm run build`, obviously. Also, make sure your bots have all the required permissions as explained above.

Before you run docker-compose, use `touch revcord.sqlite` to create the database file and leave it empty.

Then you should be ready to go.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

[^1]: Alternatively, you can edit the `docker-compose.yml` file appropriately. Make sure to remove `./.env:/app/.env` below `volumes:` so it won't complain when you don't have a `.env` file.


## üîß Configuration

### with commands

You can use either slash commands on Discord or `rc!` prefix on Revolt (use `rc!help` to show all commands)

To use the commands, **you** need the `Administrator` permission on Discord. On Revolt, only the server owner can run them (for now).

### Connecting Discord and Revolt channels 

From **Discord**:
```
/connect <Revolt channel name or ID>
```

From **Revolt**:
```
rc!connect <Discord channel name or ID>
```

For example:
```
# From Discord
/connect lounge
/connect 01AB23BC34CD56DE78ZX90WWDB

# From Revolt
rc!connect general
rc!connect 591234567890123456
```

‚úîÔ∏è Send a message to see if it works. Try editing and deleting it.

### Removing the connection

From **Discord**:
```
/disconnect
```

From **Revolt**:
```
rc!disconnect
```

You don't have to specify any channel. It will disconnect the channel the command is sent in.

### Showing connections

From **Discord**:
```
/connections
```

From **Revolt**:
```
rc!connections
```

### Toggling bots

You can toggle whether messages sent by bots should be forwarded. It's enabled by default (it's requied for NQN to work properly).

Use either `rc!bots` or `/bots`

### with mappings.json (not recommended)

#### This is not recommended!

1. Create a `mappings.json` file in the root directory.
2. Use the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "discord": "discord_channel_id",
    "revolt": "revolt_channel_id"
  },
  {
    "discord": "another_discord_channel_id",
    "revolt": "another_revolt_channel_id"
  }
]
```
